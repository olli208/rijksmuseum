### About
This is the repo for a Single Page Webapp. Using the Rijksmuseum API you can search trough their collection of 1.000's of art pieces. This app used these libraries:
- [Routie] (http://projects.jga.me/routie/)
- [Handlebars] (http://handlebarsjs.com/)

For the course Web App from scratch, we got an assignment where we made an app with which you can get and manipulate data from an external API. Besides the earlier mentioned libraries I use vanilla JavaScript.

###For convenience, I made a diagram about the app structure:

####and the flowchart

Right now the app has 1 function. You can search different queries and you get 20 results out of the Rijksmuseum collection. In the future I would like to add more functions like:
- Different pages, so you can get all the results and page through them
- a robust filtering which the official Rijksmuseum has
- ES5 -> ES6 
- Option to like or share a painting
- download option
- and more...
