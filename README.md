# Performance matters - (web-app-from-scratch - nodeJS version)

## repo for performance matters 

### About
This repo is a server side version of [this assignment](https://github.com/olli208/web-app-from-scratch). Using expressroutes.js I tried to make a minimal version of that app. 

## Run the App
When you have [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your computer run the following command:
```
npm start
```
Then go to 
> http://localhost:3000/

## Build
To build run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
[Browserfy](http://browserify.org/) makes a buildroutes.js file with all the dependencies needed.

TO DO:
- "Real" Search function
- implement Service Worker
