### About
This repo is a server side version of [this assignment](https://github.com/olli208/web-app-from-scratch). Using express.js I tried to make a minimal version of that app. 

## Run the App
When you have [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your computer run the following command:
```
npm start
```
Then go to
